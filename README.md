# odin-project-weather-app

Simple Weather App that lets you search for location and displays weather data.

Made this to improve in:
* Async/await
* Promises
* Using data from APIs

Improvements to be done:
* Put code in modules to improve scalability and readability.
* Be able to click on each day to display more info of weather on that day.
